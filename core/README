                        openMDX/Core

-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes how to setup an openMDX development 
   environment for Ant and Eclipse. If you do not intend to do 
   openMDX development you can skip this README and extract the
   openMDX/Core runtime libraries located in jre-1.5/core/lib.


2/ Download openMDX/Core
   ---------------------

   First you need to get the distribution of openMDX
   (e.g. openmdx-2.0.0-core.jre-1.5.zip) from 
   http://www.openmdx.org/downloads.htm. You can get distributions 
   for jre-1.5.
   
   IMPORTANT
   It is strongly recommended to use JDK 1.5 or JDK 6 to build 
   openMDX/Core.


3/ Setting up for Ant
   ------------------
   (hint: Ant is available from http://ant.apache.org/)
   
   Unzip the openMDX distribution to your project directory.
   
   The top level structure of the unzipped folder should look 
   something like:
   
   openmdx-2.0.0
     ant
     core
       build.xml
       LICENSE
       README
       RELEASE-NOTES
       version.properties
     java2
       [jre-1.5]
     [jre-1.5]
       core
         deployment-unit
         lib
         src
     source-archive
       core
   
   Now open a shell and cd to the directory openmdx-2.0.0/core. Verify
   the environment settings with
   
   > ant config
   
   The output looks like this:
   
     [echo] user.build.properties          = [+] ~\build.properties
     [echo] target.platform.properties     = [+] C:\pj\openmdx\core/jre-1.5-properties.xml

     [echo] project.version.properties     = [-] C:\pj\openmdx\core\version.properties
     [echo]
     [echo] ant.home                       = C:\pgm\apache-ant-1.7.0
     [echo] openmdx.home                   = C:\pj\openmdx

     [echo] project.home                   = C:\pj\openmdx
     [echo]
     [echo] build.target.jre               = [+] C:\pgm\Java\jdk1.5.0\jre
     [echo] JRE_12                         = [-]
     [echo] JRE_13                         = [-]
     [echo] JRE_14                         = [+] c:\pgm\Java\j2sdk1.4.2\jre
     [echo] JRE_15                         = [+] C:\pgm\Java\jdk1.5.0\jre
     [echo]
     [echo] ant.version                    = Apache Ant version 1.7.0 compiled on December 13 2006
     [echo] ant.java.version               = 1.6
     [echo] ant.project.name               = openmdx-core
     [echo]
     [echo] basedir                        = C:\pj\openmdx\core
     [echo] base.dir.name                  = core
     [echo] build.dir                      = C:\pj\openmdx\core\build\jre-1.5
     [echo] tmp.dir                        = C:\pj\openmdx\core\build\jre-1.5\tmp
     [echo] log.dir                        = C:\pj\openmdx\core\build\jre-1.5\log
     [echo] deliver.dir                    = C:\pj\openmdx\jre-1.5\core
     [echo] distribution.dir               = C:\pj\openmdx\distribution
     [echo]
     [echo] project.vendor.name            = OMEX AG
     [echo] project.vendor.id              = ch.omex
     [echo] project.specification.title    = openMDX/Core
     [echo] project.specification.version  = 2.0
     [echo] project.implementation.version = 2.0.0
     [echo] project.implementation.prefix  = openmdx
     [echo] project.platform.list          = jre-1.4/jre-1.6/jre-1.5
     [echo]
     [echo] build.target.platform          = [+] jre-1.5
     [echo] build.java.platform            = jre-1.5
     [echo] build.target.version           = 1.5
     [echo] build.source.version           = 1.5
     [echo] build.debug                    = on
     [echo] build.optimize                 = off
     [echo]
     [echo] unix.distribution              = not set
     [echo] source.distribution            = true
     [echo] distribution.format            = zip
                
   IMPORTANT
   The precompiler of gcc is used by the build process. Make sure that gcc
   is configured on your path. On windows platforms this is typically not
   the case. In this case you can use the gcc located in 
   openmdx\core\thirdparty\bin\windows.
      
   As a next step you must install the sources:
   
   > ant install-src
   
   This expands the source-archive and creates the directory 
   openmdx-2.0.0/core/src. 
   
   You are now ready to build openMDX/Core:
   
   > ant all          
   
   Builds all deliverables and distributions.

   > ant -Dproject.platform.list="jre-1.5" distribution
   
   Builds the distribution for jre-1.5. The distributions are located in
   openmdx-2.0.0\distribution.
       

4/ Setting up for Eclipse
   ----------------------
   If you set up an Eclipse project then consider the following:
   
   - Make sure that you first install and build openMDX with Ant as described 
     in section 3/.
   - Create a project in the directory core. Core is in fact an openMDX 
     project folder. There are other openMDX projects, e.g. example-lab, 
     example-helloworld which are located at the same level as core. 
   - For more information see the openMDX Quick Start Guide.
