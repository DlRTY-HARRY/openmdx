0.    SUMMARY

      * Support for JPA. Generation of JPA-compliant persistence classes
        and ORM mappings. Ant task create-schema creates OpenJPA schema.
        Ant task create-sql creates SQL scripts based on OpenJPA schema.
        Ant the same time removed support for JPOX.
      * Removed old features
      * Fixed bugs
      
            
1.    NEW FEATURES
      
      CR20018509
      Optimistic Locking
      
      The MODEL/optimisticLocking configuration entry has now three possible
      values:
      * false
        disables optimistic locking
      * whenModified
        enables optimistic locking for modified objects
      * true
        enables optimistic locking even for unmodified objects
      
      CR20018534
      Replace JPOX by OpenJPA. The model mapper now generates JPA compliant
      persistence classes and a default persistence mapping (orm.xml). The
      JDO2 mapping is not supported anymore. The ant build-library provides
      the following targets:
      * enhance: enhances the classes listed in orm.xml
      * create-schema: orm.xml --> openjpa-schema.xml
      * create-sql: openjpa-schema --> sql build and upgrade script
      CR20018528
      library-directory 
                
      The lightweight container supports the library-directory entry in the
      application XML
      * no library-directory entry leads to the default value "lib"
      * an empty library-directory entry disables the library-directory 
        feature
      * a non-empty library-directory entry such as "APP-INF/lib" for example
        includes all files which are located in the given directory and end 
        with ".jar" in the application class path 
       
2.    CHANGES  
     
2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES
     
			CR10008387
			Migrate models to RSM 7.5.

      CR20018576
      JMI 1 v/s Standard Mapping
      
      The standard mapping differs in the following aspects from the 
      strict JMI 1 mapping:
      * Each upper case letter starts a new word
      * Underscores do not start a new word
      * Dollar signs behave the same way as digits
      
      CR20018534
      Replace JPOX by OpenJPA. The model mapper now generates JPA compliant
      persistence classes and a default persistence mapping (orm.xml). The
      JDO2 mapping is not supported anymore. The ant build-library provides
      the following targets:
      * enhance: enhances the classes listed in orm.xml
      * create-schema: orm.xml --> openjpa-schema.xml
      * create-sql: openjpa-schema --> sql build and upgrade script

      CR20018521
      NoClassDefFoundError in BasicException
      
      BasicException should not throw a NoClassDefFoundError if the J2EE 
      exception classes it refers to are not bundled with a client for example. 
      
2.1.  FIXED BUGS

      CR20018536
      Filter values for persistent-new objects
      
      Filter values (Path) are now able to match their persistent-new object's
      representation (Object_1_0) 

2.2.  DEPRECATED FEATURES
      none

2.3.  REMOVED FEATURES
      none
