      Migrate UML2Tools. Migrate UML2Tools to Papyrus / GraphViz:
      * Use Eclipse / Payprus (or any other Eclipse/EMF compliant tool) for editing
        the model (.uml files).
      * Use GraphViz to render diagrams. openCRX does not come with Papyrus diagrams.
        Instead, the diagrams are described as GraphViz compliant graphs and rendered

      The new ant target "model-diagrams" generates the diagrams:
      * Complete the manually created GraphViz templates (.dott) located in ./src/model/graphviz. 
        The utility Model_1DiagramDrawer completes the templates (place-holders ${CLASS}, 
        ${ASSOCIATION} and ${INSTANCE_OF}) with the current model information and 
        generates GraphViz compliant .dot files.
