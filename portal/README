-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes how to setup openMDX/Portal for Ant 
   and Eclipse. If you do not intend to build and debug the project 
   you can skip this README and proceed to the openMDX/Portal
   installation guide.


2/ Download openMDX/Portal
   -----------------------

   First you need to get the distribution of openMDX/Core
   (e.g. openmdx-2.1.0-core.jre-1.5.zip) from 
   http://www.openmdx.org/downloads.htm. You can get distributions 
   for jre-1.5.

   Second you need to get the distribution of openMDX/Portal
   (e.g. openmdx-2.1.0-portal.jre-1.5.zip) from 
   http://www.openmdx.org/downloads.htm.

   IMPORTANT
   It is strongly recommended to use JDK 1.5 or JDK 6 to build 
   openMDX/Portal.
   

3/ Setting up for Ant
   ------------------
   
   Setting up openMDX/Core
   -----------------------
   Unzip the openMDX/Core distribution to your project directory. 
   
   IMPORTANT
   If you are using winzip, jar or tar for extraction ignore the 
   warnings for conflicting files. The conflicting files are identical 
   in all distributions.
   
   The top level structure of the unzipped folder should look 
   something like:
   
   The top level structure of the unzipped folder should look like:
   
   openmdx-2.1.0
     ant
     core
       build.xml
       LICENSE
       README
       RELEASE-NOTES
       version.properties
     java2
       [jre-1.5]
     [jre-1.5]
       core
         deployment-unit
         lib
         src
     source-archive
       core
   

   Setting up openMDX/Portal
   -------------------------------------
   Unzip the openMDX/Portal distribution to the same project directory
   as openMDX/Core. This adds the directory portal to openmdx-2.1.0.
   The top level structure of the unzipped folder should look like:
   
   openmdx-2.1.0
     ant
     core
       build.xml
       LICENSE
       README
       RELEASE-NOTES
       version.properties
     portal
       build.xml
       LICENSE
       README
       RELEASE-NOTES
       version.properties
     java2
       [jre-1.5]
     [jre-1.5]
       core
         deployment-unit
         lib
         src
       portal
         deployment-unit
         lib
         src
     source-archive
       core
       portal

   Now open a shell and cd to the directory 'portal'. Expand and 
   install the openMDX/Portal sources with the command:
   
   > ant install-src
   
   You are now ready to build openMDX/Portal. You can use the 
   following targets:
   
   > ant all
   
   Builds the distributions for jre-1.5.
   
   > ant distribution
   
   Builds the distribution for jre-1.5.
             

4/ Setting up for Eclipse
   ----------------------
   Setting up an Eclipse project for openMDX/Portal is straight-forward.
   If you create a new Eclipse project consider the following:
   
   - Make sure that you first install and build openMDX/Portal for 
     Ant as described in section 3/.
   - Create the Eclipse project in the directory 'portal'. Either add
     an Eclipse project dependency to Eclipse project in 'core' or add the
     required openMDX libraries to the openMDX 2 ~ Portal classpath.
