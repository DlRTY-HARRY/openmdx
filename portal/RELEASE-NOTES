==============================================================================
Version 2.12.7                                                      2013-11-04
==============================================================================

1.    NEW FEATURES
      
      CR10011700
      Unify edit and new object. The "New..." object form allows to lookup 
      (with auto-completer) existing objects. If an object is selected, the form 
      is pre-filled with the selected object values. After editing the form, the 
      user can then choose either to "Create" (a new) or "Save" (the existing) object. 
      If no existing object is selected, the user only can "Create".

      CR10011691
      Ui1: css classes for UI elements. Custom css classes for UI elements. 
      Allow to specify different classes for field groups and object containers. 
      Css classes are customized in UI XML files with the properties cssClassFieldGroup
      and cssClassObjectContainer, e.g.      
      
		<org.openmdx.ui1.ElementDefinition name="org:openmdx:kernel:activity1:Activity:name">
			<_object>
				<active>true</active>
				<toolTip>
					<_item>Name of activity</_item>
				</toolTip>
				<label>
					<_item>Name</_item>
				</label>
				<order>
					<_item>0</_item>
					<_item>0</_item>
					<_item>10</_item>
				</order>
				<cssClassFieldGroup>classActivityName1</cssClassFieldGroup>
				<cssClassObjectContainer>classActivityName2</cssClassObjectContainer>
			</_object>
			<_content/>
		</org.openmdx.ui1.ElementDefinition>

      CR10011280
      Grids: show total rows. The total rows in a grid are calculated when 
      going to a page with number > 0. Once calculated, the total rows are
      displayed for this grid. 

      CR10010108
      Cascading code fields. Code fields are rendered as cascaded drop-downs for
      {main category} and {sub category} in case their long texts have the format 
      {main category}|{sub category}.
      
      CR10011631
      Grids: custom queries for object identities.
      Grids should support custom-queries for object identities. The search form displays an 
      additional search field in case PortalExtension.getQuery() returns a non-null query for 
      the feature 'grid.getReferencedTypeName() + ":" + identity'.
      
      Example:
      Activities are searched for the attributes name, description or detailedDescription 
      if getQuery() returns the query-extension
      
      (UPPER(v.name) LIKE UPPER(" + s0 + ") OR UPPER(v.name) LIKE " + s1 + " OR UPPER(v.description) 
      LIKE UPPER(" + s2 + ") OR UPPER(v.description) LIKE " + s3 + " OR UPPER(v.detailed_description) 
      LIKE UPPER(" + s4 + ") OR UPPER(v.detailed_description) LIKE " + s5 + ")"
       
      for the feature 'org:opencrx:kernel:activity1:Activity:identity'. 
      
      CR10011507
      JoiningListDataBinding. Data binding which allows to collect objects from 
      a specified set of reference features and display in a grid.
