==============================================================================
Version 2.6.0                                                       2010-05-01
==============================================================================

1.    NEW FEATURES
      
      CR20006361
      Application-specific ApplicationContext. The option 
      'applicationContextClassName' allows to configure a user-defined
      ApplicationContext class. The user-defined class must be a subclass of
      org.openmdx.portal.servlet.ApplicationContext.
                                    
2.    CHANGES  
     
2.0.  CHANGED FEATURES
      
      CR10009198
      PortalExtension: getDataBinding(). The signature of getDataBinding() has changed. 
      The parameter ApplicationContext app is removed because data bindings must not 
      depend on the application context. The new interface DataBinding_2_0 has been 
      added to support data bindings where the application context is passed as 
      parameter for setValue(), getValue(). 
      
      CR20018907
      Portal: Ajax-based login.
      Login.jsp now first invokes the protected ./jsp/GetPath.jsp. The session 
      is not authenticated if GetPath returns the redirect URL to the Login page. 
      In this case the Login form is displayed. If GetPath returns the non-redirected 
      URL, Login.jsp forwards to the ObjectInspectorServlet without displaying 
      the login form. As a consequence /jsp/* must be protected in web.xml. 
            
2.1.  FIXED BUGS
      none

2.2.  DEPRECATED FEATURES
      none
            
2.3   REMOVED FEATURES
      none
