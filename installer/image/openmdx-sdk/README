Welcome to openMDX SDK!
-----------------------

This installer has created an openMDX development environment.
The SDK contains the sources of the following openMDX projects:

* core: contains the openMDX Core
* portal: contains the openMDX Portal
* security: contains the openMDX Security extensions
* tomcat: contains the Tomcat extensions
* websphere: contains the WebSphere extensions

Each project contains a build.xml which accepts the following
targets:

* clean: clean the project
* install-src: expand project source files
* deliverables: compile and build JARs
* distribution: compile, build JARs and distribution
* config: display the project settings

The installer has already performed install-src and assemble 
for each project.

The projects come with Eclipse project files. Run 
'ant distribution' on the project before opening the project
with Eclipse. This generates all required source files.


IMPORTANT:
Make sure to set the environment by running the scripts 
./setenv.bat on Windows or ./setenv.sh on Linux platforms.
