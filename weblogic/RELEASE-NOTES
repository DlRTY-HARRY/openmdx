0.    SUMMARY
      Changes since openMDX 1.11:
      * The AirLockIdentityAsserter MBean must be build explicitely with 
        the task 'ant assemble'.
      * Key and certificate provider startup classes replaced by
        resource adapters.
      * Supports WebLogic 8 and WebLogic 9 which requires the 
        platform specific WebLogic home environment variables 
        WEBLOGIC_8 and WEBLOGIC_9 to be set, e.g.
        
        SET WEBLOGIC_8=C:\opt\BEA\weblogic81
        SET WEBLOGIC_9=C:\opt\BEA\weblogic92

      Key- und Certificate Provider für wls 9
      
      Withg the introduction of the key store resource adapter pattern
      key and certificate provider factories are put into the JNDI tree
      (as opposed the key and certificate providers themselves).
      
      The following classes have therefore been removed
      * org.openmdx.base.security.pki.DeployedCertificateProvider
      * org.openmdx.base.security.pki.DeployedKeyProvider   
      
      CR0006102
      Get rid of org.openmdx.uses.java.beans classes
      
      Replace references to org.openmdx.uses.java.beans classes by references 
      to java.beans classes wherever possible.
      
      The java.beans classes aere available in the JRE from Java 2 Release 
      1.4 on, except for the IndexedPropertyChangeEvent class.
