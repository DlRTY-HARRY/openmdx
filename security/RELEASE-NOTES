1.    NEW FEATURES

      CR20019273
      Key Store Resource Adapter
      
      Setting the ManagedConnectionFactory's 'ConnectionType' property to 
      'VALIDATOR_CONNECTION' has the following effect:
      * The 'UserName' attribute is not treated as key store entry alias but 
        as certificate path validation algorithm (usually "PKIX").
      * The connections are instances of ValidatorConnection and implement
        CertificateValidator
