-------------------------------------------------------------------

1/ What this guide is for
   ----------------------

   This README describes how to setup openMDX/Security for Ant 
   and Eclipse. If you do not intend to build and debug the project 
   you can skip this README and proceed to the openMDX/Security
   installation guide.


2/ Download openMDX/Security
   -----------------------

   First you need to get the distribution of openMDX/Core
   (e.g. openmdx-1.18.2-core.jre-1.5.zip) from 
   http://www.openmdx.org/downloads.htm.

   Second you need to get the distribution of openMDX/Security
   (e.g. openmdx-1.18.2-security.jre-1.5.zip) from 
   http://www.openmdx.org/downloads.htm.

   IMPORTANT
   It is strongly recommended to use JDK 1.5 or JDK 6 to build 
   openMDX/Core.
   

3/ Setting up for Ant
   ------------------
   
   Setting up openMDX/Core
   -----------------------
   Unzip the openMDX/Core distribution to your project directory. 
   
   The top level structure of the unzipped folder should look 
   something like:
   
   The top level structure of the unzipped folder should look like:
   
   openmdx-1.18.2
     ant
     core
       build.xml
       LICENSE
       README
       RELEASE-NOTES
       version.properties
     java2
       [jre-1.5]
     [jre-1.5]
       core
         deployment-unit
         lib
         src
     source-archive
       core
   

   Setting up openMDX/Security
   -------------------------------------
   Unzip the openMDX/Security distribution to the same project directory
   as openMDX/Core. This adds the directory 'security' to openmdx-1.18.2.
   The top level structure of the unzipped folder should look like:
   
   openmdx-1.18.2
     ant
     core
       build.xml
       LICENSE
       README
       RELEASE-NOTES
       version.properties
     security
       build.xml
       LICENSE
       README
       RELEASE-NOTES
       version.properties
     java2
       [jre-1.5]
     [jre-1.5]
       core
         deployment-unit
         lib
         src
       security
         deployment-unit
         lib
         src
     source-archive
       core
       security

   Now open a shell and cd to the directory 'security'. Expand and 
   install the openMDX/Security sources with the command:
   
   > ant install-src
   
   You are now ready to build openMDX/Security. You can use the 
   following targets:
   
   > ant all
   
   Builds the distributions for jre-1.5 and/or jre-1.5.
   
   > ant -Dproject.platform.list="jre-1.5" distribution
             

4/ Setting up for Eclipse
   ----------------------
   Setting up an Eclipse project for openMDX/Security is straight-forward.
   If you create a new Eclipse project consider the following:
   
   - Make sure that you first install and build openMDX/Security for 
     Ant as described in section 3/.
   - Create the Eclipse project in the directory 'security'. Either add
     an Eclipse project dependency to Eclipse project in 'core' or add the
     required openMDX libraries to the openMDX 1 ~ Security classpath.
